T06 - NES LockBox
=========

ECE411 - Practicum project

=======
Remember the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)? We sure do.  This project is the brain child of Carlos Mariscal.  It simply is a box that locks. But thats not the cool part.  This box is electronically locked, and must be unlocked by using the old school NES controller as a user interface.  

YES! This thing rocks!!!
